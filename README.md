# 🚀 Dockerized Express.js + PostgreSQL App (Prisma ORM)

This project was created as a **learning-focused backend application** to understand how to build, configure, and run an **Express.js API with PostgreSQL** using **Prisma ORM**, fully **dockerized with Docker and Docker Compose**.

The main goal of this project is to practice **real-world backend setup** and learn how Docker helps create consistent and portable development environments.
